# Training on large language models for genomics

# Overview

In this repo, we will follow a training for large language models (LLMs) for genomics. The training comprises a short lecture and several lab classes.

# Lab classes


## Data to pretrain the model

Data:
- **data/genome_sequences/hg38/sequences_hg38_200b_small.csv.gz** (10% of the human genome)
- **data/genome_sequences/hg38/sequences_hg38_200b_verysmall.csv.gz** (1% of the human genome)

## Pretraining of an LLM on DNA sequences

The script can be ran on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gcw_MYiqwB-pbVYHIx8kevx-ZD7sqMxL#scrollTo=JTYKjBrwRSU6).
